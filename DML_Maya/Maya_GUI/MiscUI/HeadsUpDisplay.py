	"""
	This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) object which is placed in a 2D
	inactive overlay plane on the 3D viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-on
	information designated by a user script. The text string displayed on the viewport
	is formatted using the various flags of this command.
	
	The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section and block flags. Note if the preset
	OR command/trigger flags are not present, only a label will be drawn on the viewport.
	
	Upon creation of a HUD object, an ID number will be assigned to it. This can be used to
	remove the HUD object (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired. Alternatively, HUD
	objects may be removed via their position (section and block), or their unique name.

				This setting is used to select certain pre-defined HUDs, some of which retrieve

				cameraNames
				This will return the camera name that the view is looking through, in
				the data block, for each view that the HUD is drawing to.
				polyVerts
				This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of
				vertices that are visible by the camera.
				
				1st Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, both
				active and inactive.
				2nd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, on
				active objects only.
				3rd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, that
				are active.
				
				polyEdges
				This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of
				edges that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are
				similar to the polyVerts preset.
				polyFaces
				This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of
				faces that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are
				similar to the polyVerts preset.
				polyUVs
				This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of
				UVs that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are
				similar to the polyVerts preset.
				polyTriangles
				This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of
				triangles that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are
				similar to the polyVerts preset.
				materialLoadingCount
				This will return the material loading count.
				It updates on each refresh.
				textureLoadingCount
				This will return the texture loading count.
				It updates on each refresh.
				frameRate

				Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above.
				For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the
				section would be defined as: -sec 1
				
				To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a
				clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence,
				where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending
				on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to
				a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the
				HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of
				least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
				issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only
				the section of highest priority remains.
				
				For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top
				row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed
				by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority.
				Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of
				the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied
				to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest
				priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining
				two sections are of lowest priority.
				
				This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width
				to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections
				1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
				finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.
